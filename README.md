# CLASSLESS VERSION

FIKO provides a `.classless` version ([example](https://FIKOcss.com/examples/classless)).

In this version, `header`, `main` and `footer` act as containers.

Use the default `.classless` version if you need centered viewports:

Or use the `.fluid.classless` version if you need a fluid container:

Then just write pure HTML, and it should look great:


# RESET CSS ON STEROIDS LIMITATIONS

FIKO can be used without custom CSS for quick or small projects.
`fiko.css`

However, it’s designed to provide a starting point, like a “reset CSS on steroids”.

the `fiko.classes.css` versions do not integrate any helpers or utilities in

Developing with `fiko.css` require modern CSS knowledge to add any custom look.
