## BASE CLASSLESS 2023 CSS TEMPLATE

**Class-light and semantic**

**Great styles with just one CSS file**
No dependencies, package manager, external files, or JavaScript.

**Responsive everything**
Elegant and consistent adaptive spacings and typography on all devices.

**Light or Dark mode**
Shipped with two beautiful color themes, automatically enabled according to the user preference.

# Usage

There are 4 ways to get started with FIKO.css:

**Install manually**

[Download FIKO](https://github.com/junglesta/fiko/fiko.zip) and link `/css/fiko.min.css` in the `<head>` of your website.

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="css/fiko.min.css" />
```

**Install with PNPM**

```shell
pnpm install @junglesta/fiko
```

# CLASSLESS Version

FIKO provides a `.classless` version ([example](https://FIKOcss.com/examples/classless)).

In this version, `header`, `main` and `footer` act as containers.

Use the default `.classless` version if you need centered viewports:

Or use the `.fluid.classless` version if you need a fluid container:

Then just write pure HTML, and it should look great:


# RESET CSS ON STEROIDS Limitations

FIKO can be used without custom CSS for quick or small projects.

However, it’s designed as a starting point, like a “reset CSS on steroids”.

As FIKO does not integrate any helpers or utilities `.classes`, this minimal CSS framework requires SCSS or CSS knowledge to build large projects.
