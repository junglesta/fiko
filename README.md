üê∏ VARIABLE EVERYTHING.
üê∏ LIGHT OR DARK MODE.
üê∏ USES NATIVE HTML.
üê∏ LAYERS.
üê∏ MODERN NORMALISE.

# ü´µ USE IT

## Usage: **Install**

```shell
pnpm i fiko
```

## Usage: **Import**

```css
@import "node_modules/fiko/fiko.css";
```

then:

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="node_modules/fiko/package/fiko.css" />
```

Or

## Usage: **Download**

[Download FIKO](https://github.com/TOYBREAKER/fiko/fiko.zip) and link `/fiko.css` it in the `<head>` of your website.

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="fiko.css" />
```

Or

## Usage: **Astro**

```astro
import 'fiko.css';
```

Or

## Usage: **HTML**

Put your custom styles on top of fiko, make sure to not use `!important` in your css cos it might break things.

```shell
import 'fiko' from 'path/to/fiko.css'
import 'my_custom_style' from 'path/to/my_custom_style.css'
```

Most use case will need some custom, brand related styles...

## Usage: **CUSTOM CSS ON TOP OF FIKO**

Write your `my_custom_style.css` you can leverage the existing `fiko layers`, just mind the order`.

```css
/* ||| Layer Order Declaration ||| */
@layer base, root, toggle, containers, components;
```

### WHY?

The goal here is to reduce specificity born problems, by isolating rules.
Refer to the code comments right inside `fiko.css` to decide where to put your rules. I'd say you probably go something like this:

```css
@layer components {
  .button {
    color: green;
  }
  .call-to-action {
    font-size: 4ch;
    font-weight: 100;
    border: 1px solid pink;
  }
}
```

or

```css
@layer root {
  :root {
    --color-white: #7fffd4;
    --color-black: #222222;
  }
}
```

or, if you want to change just one color of the 4 can go like this:

```css
@layer root {
  :root {
    --dark-mode: var(--color-darkblue);
  }
}
```

or define it just for one page, and just the dark color, like this:

```html
<head>
  ...
  <style>
    @layer root {
      :root {
        --color-darkblue: darkblue;
        --dark-mode: var(--color-darkblue);
      }
    }
  </style>
</head>
```

# ü´µ DEVELOP

.

## FRONTEND [DEMO PAGE](https://fiko.rokma.rocks)

Fiko comes with a demo page, useful to test when dev.

Run a simple Python server on lh:3000. (Install Python for your sys first!)

```shell
# üê≤ DRY RECURRING START
echo '|';
echo 'cd package/';
cd dist/web/;
echo '|';
echo 'üê≤ now i am here:';
CWD=$(pwd -P)
echo $CWD
echo '|';
echo 'serve';
serve
```

## UPGRADE

```shell
# Start by LIVING IN THE FUTURE:
pnpm upgrade
```

## SEE INCLUDED SCRIPTS

```shell
# See ALL THE AVAILABLE SCRIPTS like this:
cat package.json
```

## LAUNCH NEW PROJECT

```shell
# FIKO ASTRO START, PASTE this one:
pnpm create astro@latest && pnpm add fiko
```

## ADD TO EXISTING PROJECT

```shell
# Add to EXISTING PROJECT using NPM:
npm astro add fiko
```

.

## NPM CAVEAT

Sometimes you need to solve dep's issues. This helps a lot, many times:

```shell
pnpm install --install-strategy=nested`
```

`--install-strategy=nested`,
Formerly `legacy-bundling`,
instead of hoisting package installs in node_modules,
installs packages in the same manner that they are depended on.
NOTE: This may cause very deep directory structures and duplicate package installs as there is no de-duplicating.

.

# LIMITATIONS

FIKO can be used without custom CSS for quick or small projects. However, it‚Äôs designed to provide a starting point, like a ‚Äúreset CSS on steroids‚Äù. Developing with `fiko.css` require modern CSS knowledge to add any custom look.

### BROWSER SUPPORT

FIKO is designed and tested for the latest stable Chrome, Firefox, Edge, and Safari releases. It does NOT support any version of IE, including IE 11.
