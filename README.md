# ü´µ WAY TO USE IT (actually, don't use it yet, WIP v0.17.1)

.

## Usage: **Install**

```shell
pnpm i fiko
```

## Usage: **Import**

```css
@import 'node_modules/fiko/fiko.css';
```

then in the page `<head>`:

```html
/* tell browser that page supports light & dark modes */
<meta name="color-scheme" content="light dark" />
<link
  rel="stylesheet"
  href="node_modules/fiko/package/fiko.css"
/>
```

Or

## Usage: **Download**

[Download FIKO](https://github.com/TOYBREAKER/fiko/fiko.zip) and link `/fiko.css` it in the `<head>` of your website.

```html
/* tell browser that page supports light & dark modes */
<meta name="color-scheme" content="light dark" />
<link rel="stylesheet" href="fiko.css" />
```

Or

## Usage: **Astro**

```astro
import 'fiko.css';
```

Or

## Usage: **HTML**

Put your custom styles on top of fiko, make sure to not use `!important` in your css cos it might break things.

```shell
import 'fiko' from 'path/to/fiko.css'
import 'my_custom_style' from 'path/to/my_custom_style.css'
```

Or probably also as show here:

```html
<link
  rel="stylesheet"
  href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/toybreaker/fiko/main/package/fiko.css"
/>
```

Most use case will need some custom, brand related styles...

## Usage: **CUSTOM CSS ON TOP OF FIKO**

Write your `my_custom_style.css` you can leverage the existing `fiko layers`, just mind the order`.

```css
/* ||| Layer Order Declaration ||| */
@layer reset, root, base, roles, toggle, containers, components, classes;
```

### FIKO CSS Advanced color management system.

Leveraging CSS variables for dynamic theming and opacity control. This system ensures applications can adapt to different branding and user preferences seamlessly.

Central to FIKO's color management are CSS variables, enabling developers to define a color palette that applies across the entire application, offering consistency and the ease of updating themes or implementing dark mode.

For instance, defining a primary color in the root:

```css
:root {
  --color-primary: rgba(
    52,
    152,
    219,
    1
  ); /* Opacity adjustable */
}
.button {
  background-color: var(--color-primary);
}
```

This snippet demonstrates setting a primary color,
which can be used across the application for consistent theming.

FIKO also addresses the need for dynamic theming,
including dark and light modes,
through media queries and conditional CSS variables,
allowing applications to adapt to user preferences automatically:

```css
@media (prefers-color-scheme: dark) {
  :root {
    --background-color: #333;
    --text-color: #fff;
  }
}
```

Furthermore,
FIKO simplifies the application-wide color scheme adjustments by using CSS variables like
`--currentBGcolor`
and
`--currentTXTcolor`
set to
`--color-white`
and
`--color-black`
respectively.

This abstraction layer allows for easily changing themes
or color schemes by updating a few root-level variables,
without the need for individual component style modifications.

For overriding default color variables in FIKO,
simply redefine the variable in the appropriate scope.

For example, to

### Change the background color for a specific element:

```css
.special-section {
  --currentBGcolor: var(--color-special);
}
```

This practice ensures a flexible, reusable, and maintainable approach to color management across your application, embodying modern web design's best practices.

In summary,
FIKO CSS's color management system offers a robust foundation for creating dynamic, adaptable, and visually cohesive web applications.

By utilizing CSS variables for centralized color definitions and supporting automatic theme switching, developers can craft applications that are both aesthetically pleasing and user-friendly, aligning with diverse design requirements and preferences.

### WHY?

The goal here is to reduce specificity born problems, by isolating rules.

Refer to the code comments right inside `fiko.css` to decide where to put your rules.

I'd say you probably go something like this:

```css
@layer components {
  .button {
    color: green;
  }
  .call-to-action {
    font-size: 4ch;
    font-weight: 100;
    border: 1px solid pink;
  }
}
```

or

```css
@layer root {
  :root {
    --color-white: #7fffd4;
    --color-black: #222222;
  }
}
```

or, if you want to change just one color of the 4 can go like this:

```css
@layer root {
  :root {
    --dark-mode: var(--color-darkblue);
  }
}
```

or define it just for one page, and just the dark color, like this:

```html
<head>
  ...
  <style>
    @layer root {
      :root {
        --color-darkblue: darkblue;
        --dark-mode: var(--color-darkblue);
      }
    }
  </style>
</head>
```

Generally if you are unsure just put them into un an unnamed, anonymous layer:

```css
@layer {
  p {
    margin: 0;
  }
}
```

# ü´µ DEVELOP

.

## UPGRADE

```shell
# Start by LIVING IN THE FUTURE:
pnpm upgrade
```

## SEE INCLUDED SCRIPTS

```shell
# See ALL THE AVAILABLE SCRIPTS like this:
cat package.json
```

## LAUNCH NEW PROJECT

```shell
# FIKO ASTRO START, PASTE this one:
pnpm create astro@latest && pnpm add fiko
```

## ADD TO EXISTING PROJECT

```shell
# Add to EXISTING PROJECT using NPM:
npm astro add fiko
```

## FRONTEND [DEMO PAGE](https://fiko.rokma.rocks)

Fiko comes with a demo page, useful to test and dev.
Use Browsersync (install it system wide, it's very useful!)

```shell
# üê≤ DRY RECURRING START
browser-sync start --s 'package' --files 'package' --no-inject-changes
```

or:

```shell
cd package && browser-sync start --s
```

Now you have an auto-reload server whatching all files in 'package'. You'd see this in your terminal:

```shell
Local: http://localhost:3000
External: http://192.168.100.103:3000
```

.

## NPM CAVEAT

Sometimes you need to solve dep's issues. This helps a lot, many times:

```shell
pnpm install --install-strategy=nested
```

`--install-strategy=nested`,
Formerly `legacy-bundling`,
instead of hoisting package installs in node_modules,
installs packages in the same manner that they are depended on.

NOTE: This may cause very deep directory structures and duplicate package installs as there is no de-duplicating.

.

# LIMITATIONS

FIKO can be used without custom CSS for quick or small projects. However, it‚Äôs designed to provide a starting point, like a ‚Äúreset CSS on steroids‚Äù.

Developing with `fiko.css` require modern CSS knowledge to add any custom look.

### BROWSER SUPPORT

FIKO is designed and tested for the latest stable Chrome, Firefox, Edge, and Safari releases. It does NOT support any version of IE, including IE 11.
