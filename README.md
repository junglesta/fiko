# 🫵 DEVELOP CLI STUFF

---

## FRONTEND

Run a simple Python server on lh:3000.
(You'll need to install Python for your sys first!)

```shell
# 🐲 DRY RECURRING START
echo '|';
echo 'cd dist/web/';
cd dist/web/;
echo '|';
echo '🐲 now i am here:';
CWD=$(pwd -P)
echo $CWD
echo '|';
echo 'serve';
serve
```

## PACKAGE

```shell
# Start by LIVING IN THE FUTURE:
pnpm upgrade
```

## BUILD

```shell
# BUILD.
pnpm run F
```

## DEV

```shell
# DEV:
pnpm run dev
```

or with bash shortcut:

```shell
prc
```

## LINT

```shell
# LINT:
pnpm run lint
```

## SEE INCLUDED SCRIPTS

```shell
# See ALL THE AVAILABLE SCRIPTS like this:
cat package.json
```

## LAUNCH NEW PROJECT

```shell
# FIKO ASTRO START, PASTE this one:
pnpm create astro@latest && pnpm add fiko
```

## OPEN FIKO NPM PAGE

```shell
# Open fiko NPM page in the default browser:
pnpm repo
```

## ADD TO EXISTING PROJECT

```shell
# Add to EXISTING PROJECT using NPM:
npm astro add fiko
```

.

## NPM CAVEAT

Sometimes you need to solve dep's issues. This helps a lot, many times:

```shell
pnpm install --install-strategy=nested`
```

`--install-strategy=nested`,
formerly `legacy-bundling`,
instead of hoisting package installs in node_modules,
installs packages in the same manner that they are depended on.
NOTE: This may cause very deep directory structures and duplicate package installs as there is no de-duplicating.

.

# WHY THREE VERSIONS?

> **_To cater to 3 different kinds of STARTER TEMPLATE needs._**

## FIKO `fiko.css`

Full zero config DX. Import it from NPM. Link it in yor framework. Boom. Done!

> **_Use this version when you write your own classes_**

**FIKO is compiled with this settings:**

- enable-semantic-container: true

## CLASSLESS `fiko.classless.css`

No helpers nor utilities, FIKO classless still provides: `header`,`main`, `footer` behaving as DYNAMICALLY-SPACED containers, i.e.: have horizontal spacing, and max width on `.container`.

> **_Use this version when you write your own classes_**

**FIKO CLASSLESS is compiled with this settings:**

When :

- enable-semantic-container: true
- enable-classes: false

## FLUID `fiko.fluid.css`

No max width on `.container` here. FULL-ON AT ALL TIMES!

> **_Use this version when you need a fluid, FULL-VIEWPORT container._**

**FIKO FLUID is compiled with this settings:**

- enable-semantic-container: true
- enable-viewport: false
- enable-classes: false

.

# LIMITATIONS

FIKO can be used without custom CSS for quick or small projects. However, it’s designed to provide a starting point, like a “reset CSS on steroids”. Developing with `fiko.css` require modern CSS knowledge to add any custom look.

### BROWSER SUPPORT

FIKO is designed and tested for the latest stable Chrome, Firefox, Edge, and Safari releases. It does NOT support any version of IE, including IE 11.
